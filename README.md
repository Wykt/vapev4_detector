# vape v4 detector
a (very) naive way to detect vape v4  
needs to be injected in java process  
this probably can be done externally :)

# how it works
vape v4 is made in java so there's a very easy way to detect it  
it basically checks if the main vape class (a.A) is loaded  
this can falses by having a mod with the same class name so use at your own risk (there's no mod that have the same class name afaik)
